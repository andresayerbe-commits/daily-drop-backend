Their friendship is tested when Amir betrays Hassan during a kite-fighting tournament, an event that haunts him for years. As political turmoil erupts in Afghanistan, Amir and his father flee to America, leaving Hassan behind.

Upon his return, Amir finds the country devastated and faces not only the physical dangers but also the emotional repercussions of his childhood actions.

    "taste": "I became what I am today at the age of twelve, on a frigid overcast day in late 1975. I remember the precise moment, crouching behind a crumbling mud wall, peering into the blue sky. It was the last time I saw my friend Hassan. The last time I was happy. That was the winter of 1975, and I remember the smells—fried meat and the saffron-flavored rice of the mawa, the shouts of eager boys in the streets below, the rhythmic beat of a kite string being wrapped around a spool for the kite-fighting tournament. And I remember the look of sheer determination on Hassan's face as he prepared for the day. A day that would change everything.",
