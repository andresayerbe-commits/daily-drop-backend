Meanwhile, we follow the love story between the Master, a besieged writer, and Margarita, who makes a pact with Woland to reunite with him. The narrative intertwines with a fantastical retelling of the trial of Jesus, blurring the lines between reality and fantasy as morality and desire collide.",

    "taste": "Bulgakov’s prose pulses with life: 'Manuscripts don’t burn,' a reminder that stories endure, echoing the struggle between authority and personal truth.",
